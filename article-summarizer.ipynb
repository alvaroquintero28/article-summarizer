      "A Perfect ’59 Chevy Apache? OF THE GAME\n",
      "A Crash eCourse to Classic Truck Building\n",
      "The Internet, if used correctly, can help you achieve some really great things. C’mon, don’t get too excited now, but do you really think there are local women just waiting to meet you…at 3 in the morning?! You should know better by now. ABOVE: ONE OF CHUCK’S FAVORITE ADDITIONS TO THE TRUCK ARE THE 20-INCH WHEELSMITH SPOKES WHEELS. THEY FIT THE APACHE’S NATURALLY SUBTLE PERSONALITY PERFECTLY. Just ask Chuck Velazco (@chucksee), a Miami native who has developed a rather strong connection with his keyboard. Now, he hasn’t started up his own religion or anything wild like that, but he has taught himself how to work on his own vehicle projects in the privacy of his own two-car garage.

      "“After graduating from the University of YouTube, I decided I was capable of enough to dive headfirst into air suspension, and give it a real shot,” Chuck says about his newfound knowledge. After watching endless tutorial videos and quick how-to clips, he was able to figure out what equipment and tools he would need, and how to sharpen his skills before going too far out on his own. “I learned and researched everything that I could, and even learned how to weld by watching hundreds of hours worth of instructional videos”, Chuck admits. “In the age of technology and limitless accessibility for information, we are our own greatest hurdle.” That’s some inspiring stuff. Even after spending that much time in front of the computer screen and even more hours spent applying what he had learned, Chuck doesn’t have any type of formal certification or documentation to show for his attendance at YouTube U—unless you count the existence of this ’59 Chevy Apache. This Apache isn’t Chuck’s first ride around the carousel, but it was his first experience working with this particular model. “I’ve always had a strong passion for classic Chevy trucks—they run in my blood”, Chuck says. “My late grandfather always said to buy Chevrolet because it’s the best out there.” “I was on a business trip in New York and decided to take the bridge over to the New Jersey warehouse district,” Chuck says. Chuck got real lucky when he found the truck because it had been kept indoors for quite some time. Even though the original paint did show patina, the amount of rust on this thing was very minimal. The rest of the truck seemed to be unmolested as well, with everything being original how it was in 1959 except with the natural weathering of father time and Mother Nature. Since he was more than OK with leaving the exterior just the way nature left it, he began sizing up the suspension and engine. He knew right away that he wanted to plant a brand new crate engine in the truck to take any guesswork out of a potential rebuild. Chuck even took the time to trick out the bed with Tricky Air bed shocks, which are pneumatic driven shocks that open and close the bed floor, and are controlled through a wireless remote—a first in the truck industry. It would seem that Chuck had a flawless attendance record during his days of studying. CHUCK KEPT THE MOTOR SWAP SIMPLE WITH A CLEAN CHEVY Aside from the Apache’s suspension and motor work, the interior is really the only other area that received any updating, but even that was kept at a minimum as to allow the truck’s genuine character to shine through. The original factory seat frame was utilized for reupholstering, and some new black carpet was laid down on top of a layer Dynamat sound deadening material to keep road noise down to whisper. There is still plenty of patina left to remind Chuck and his lucky passengers of the rare breed of vehicle they are lucky enough to be riding in. “The truck has just the right amount of creature comforts of a modern vehicle, and gets a lot more thumbs up than my late-model Silverado,” he says. “It’s not every day that you come across a vehicle with the particulars this one has in its current rust free state. At the end of this project, he’s come away with a real gem of knowledge that he’d like to leave with our readers. [/divider]\n",

      "A Perfect ’59 Chevy Apache? OF THE GAME\n",
      "A Crash eCourse to Classic Truck Building\n",
      "The Internet, if used correctly, can help you achieve some really great things. C’mon, don’t get too excited now, but do you really think there are local women just waiting to meet you…at 3 in the morning?! You should know better by now. ABOVE: ONE OF CHUCK’S FAVORITE ADDITIONS TO THE TRUCK ARE THE 20-INCH WHEELSMITH SPOKES WHEELS. THEY FIT THE APACHE’S NATURALLY SUBTLE PERSONALITY PERFECTLY. Just ask Chuck Velazco (@chucksee), a Miami native who has developed a rather strong connection with his keyboard. Now, he hasn’t started up his own religion or anything wild like that, but he has taught himself how to work on his own vehicle projects in the privacy of his own two-car garage.

      "“After graduating from the University of YouTube, I decided I was capable of enough to dive headfirst into air suspension, and give it a real shot,” Chuck says about his newfound knowledge. After watching endless tutorial videos and quick how-to clips, he was able to figure out what equipment and tools he would need, and how to sharpen his skills before going too far out on his own. “I learned and researched everything that I could, and even learned how to weld by watching hundreds of hours worth of instructional videos”, Chuck admits. “In the age of technology and limitless accessibility for information, we are our own greatest hurdle.” That’s some inspiring stuff. Even after spending that much time in front of the computer screen and even more hours spent applying what he had learned, Chuck doesn’t have any type of formal certification or documentation to show for his attendance at YouTube U—unless you count the existence of this ’59 Chevy Apache. This Apache isn’t Chuck’s first ride around the carousel, but it was his first experience working with this particular model. “I’ve always had a strong passion for classic Chevy trucks—they run in my blood”, Chuck says. “My late grandfather always said to buy Chevrolet because it’s the best out there.” “I was on a business trip in New York and decided to take the bridge over to the New Jersey warehouse district,” Chuck says. Chuck got real lucky when he found the truck because it had been kept indoors for quite some time. Even though the original paint did show patina, the amount of rust on this thing was very minimal. The rest of the truck seemed to be unmolested as well, with everything being original how it was in 1959 except with the natural weathering of father time and Mother Nature. Since he was more than OK with leaving the exterior just the way nature left it, he began sizing up the suspension and engine. He knew right away that he wanted to plant a brand new crate engine in the truck to take any guesswork out of a potential rebuild. Chuck even took the time to trick out the bed with Tricky Air bed shocks, which are pneumatic driven shocks that open and close the bed floor, and are controlled through a wireless remote—a first in the truck industry. It would seem that Chuck had a flawless attendance record during his days of studying. CHUCK KEPT THE MOTOR SWAP SIMPLE WITH A CLEAN CHEVY Aside from the Apache’s suspension and motor work, the interior is really the only other area that received any updating, but even that was kept at a minimum as to allow the truck’s genuine character to shine through. The original factory seat frame was utilized for reupholstering, and some new black carpet was laid down on top of a layer Dynamat sound deadening material to keep road noise down to whisper. There is still plenty of patina left to remind Chuck and his lucky passengers of the rare breed of vehicle they are lucky enough to be riding in. “The truck has just the right amount of creature comforts of a modern vehicle, and gets a lot more thumbs up than my late-model Silverado,” he says. “It’s not every day that you come across a vehicle with the particulars this one has in its current rust free state. At the end of this project, he’s come away with a real gem of knowledge that he’d like to leave with our readers. [/divider]\n",

      "A Perfect ’59 Chevy Apache? OF THE GAME\n",
      "A Crash eCourse to Classic Truck Building\n",
      "The Internet, if used correctly, can help you achieve some really great things. C’mon, don’t get too excited now, but do you really think there are local women just waiting to meet you…at 3 in the morning?! ABOVE: ONE OF CHUCK’S FAVORITE ADDITIONS TO THE TRUCK ARE THE 20-INCH WHEELSMITH SPOKES WHEELS. THEY FIT THE APACHE’S NATURALLY SUBTLE PERSONALITY PERFECTLY. Anyway, getting back to the initial public service announcement about the Internet being a positive place—it totally can be. Just ask Chuck Velazco (@chucksee), a Miami native who has developed a rather strong connection with his keyboard. Now, he hasn’t started up his own religion or anything wild like that, but he has taught himself how to work on his own vehicle projects in the privacy of his own two-car garage. Subscribe to our weekly newsletter\n",
      "“After graduating from the University of YouTube, I decided I was capable of enough to dive headfirst into air suspension, and give it a real shot,” Chuck says about his newfound knowledge. After watching endless tutorial videos and quick how-to clips, he was able to figure out what equipment and tools he would need, and how to sharpen his skills before going too far out on his own. “I learned and researched everything that I could, and even learned how to weld by watching hundreds of hours worth of instructional videos”, Chuck admits. “In the age of technology and limitless accessibility for information, we are our own greatest hurdle.” That’s some inspiring stuff. YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT KINDS OF SURPRISES CHUCK KEEPS HIDDEN INSIDE HIS OLD TOOLBOX. This Apache isn’t Chuck’s first ride around the carousel, but it was his first experience working with this particular model. “I’ve always had a strong passion for classic Chevy trucks—they run in my blood”, Chuck says. “My late grandfather always said to buy Chevrolet because it’s the best out there.” “I was on a business trip in New York and decided to take the bridge over to the New Jersey warehouse district,” Chuck says. Chuck got real lucky when he found the truck because it had been kept indoors for quite some time. Even though the original paint did show patina, the amount of rust on this thing was very minimal. The rest of the truck seemed to be unmolested as well, with everything being original how it was in 1959 except with the natural weathering of father time and Mother Nature. NO TOPPING NATURALLY WEATHERED TRIM PIECE ACCESSORIES AND PANELS. Since he was more than OK with leaving the exterior just the way nature left it, he began sizing up the suspension and engine. He knew right away that he wanted to plant a brand new crate engine in the truck to take any guesswork out of a potential rebuild. When it came time to start prepping the chassis, he ordered a few parts from PorterBuilt Fab and ended up with a fresh frame that he then upgraded with an AccuAir e-Level system and goods from RideTech. It would seem that Chuck had a flawless attendance record during his days of studying. CHUCK KEPT THE MOTOR SWAP SIMPLE WITH A CLEAN CHEVY LOOK FOR AN LS SWAP IN THE NEAR FUTURE. Aside from the Apache’s suspension and motor work, the interior is really the only other area that received any updating, but even that was kept at a minimum as to allow the truck’s genuine character to shine through. The original factory seat frame was utilized for reupholstering, and some new black carpet was laid down on top of a layer Dynamat sound deadening material to keep road noise down to whisper. There is still plenty of patina left to remind Chuck and his lucky passengers of the rare breed of vehicle they are lucky enough to be riding in. “The truck has just the right amount of creature comforts of a modern vehicle, and gets a lot more thumbs up than my late-model Silverado,” he says. “It’s not every day that you come across a vehicle with the particulars this one has in its current rust free state. I do, however, foresee an LS swap in the near future though.” Chuck would agree that he learns something new with every single truck he finishes. At the end of this project, he’s come away with a real gem of knowledge that he’d like to leave with our readers. [/divider]\n",

      "A Crash eCourse to Classic Truck Building\n",
      "The Internet, if used correctly, can help you achieve some really great things. C’mon, don’t get too excited now, but do you really think there are local women just waiting to meet you…at 3 in the morning?! ABOVE: ONE OF CHUCK’S FAVORITE ADDITIONS TO THE TRUCK ARE THE 20-INCH WHEELSMITH SPOKES WHEELS. THEY FIT THE APACHE’S NATURALLY SUBTLE PERSONALITY PERFECTLY. Anyway, getting back to the initial public service announcement about the Internet being a positive place—it totally can be. Just ask Chuck Velazco (@chucksee), a Miami native who has developed a rather strong connection with his keyboard. Now, he hasn’t started up his own religion or anything wild like that, but he has taught himself how to work on his own vehicle projects in the privacy of his own two-car garage. Subscribe to our weekly newsletter\n",
      "“After graduating from the University of YouTube, I decided I was capable of enough to dive headfirst into air suspension, and give it a real shot,” Chuck says about his newfound knowledge. After watching endless tutorial videos and quick how-to clips, he was able to figure out what equipment and tools he would need, and how to sharpen his skills before going too far out on his own. “I learned and researched everything that I could, and even learned how to weld by watching hundreds of hours worth of instructional videos”, Chuck admits. “In the age of technology and limitless accessibility for information, we are our own greatest hurdle.” That’s some inspiring stuff. YOU JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT KINDS OF SURPRISES CHUCK KEEPS HIDDEN INSIDE HIS OLD TOOLBOX. This Apache isn’t Chuck’s first ride around the carousel, but it was his first experience working with this particular model. “I’ve always had a strong passion for classic Chevy trucks—they run in my blood”, Chuck says. “My late grandfather always said to buy Chevrolet because it’s the best out there.” “I was on a business trip in New York and decided to take the bridge over to the New Jersey warehouse district,” Chuck says. Chuck got real lucky when he found the truck because it had been kept indoors for quite some time. Even though the original paint did show patina, the amount of rust on this thing was very minimal. The rest of the truck seemed to be unmolested as well, with everything being original how it was in 1959 except with the natural weathering of father time and Mother Nature. NO TOPPING NATURALLY WEATHERED TRIM PIECE ACCESSORIES AND PANELS. Since he was more than OK with leaving the exterior just the way nature left it, he began sizing up the suspension and engine. He knew right away that he wanted to plant a brand new crate engine in the truck to take any guesswork out of a potential rebuild. When it came time to start prepping the chassis, he ordered a few parts from PorterBuilt Fab and ended up with a fresh frame that he then upgraded with an AccuAir e-Level system and goods from RideTech. It would seem that Chuck had a flawless attendance record during his days of studying. CHUCK KEPT THE MOTOR SWAP SIMPLE WITH A CLEAN CHEVY LOOK FOR AN LS SWAP IN THE NEAR FUTURE. Aside from the Apache’s suspension and motor work, the interior is really the only other area that received any updating, but even that was kept at a minimum as to allow the truck’s genuine character to shine through. The original factory seat frame was utilized for reupholstering, and some new black carpet was laid down on top of a layer Dynamat sound deadening material to keep road noise down to whisper. There is still plenty of patina left to remind Chuck and his lucky passengers of the rare breed of vehicle they are lucky enough to be riding in. “The truck has just the right amount of creature comforts of a modern vehicle, and gets a lot more thumbs up than my late-model Silverado,” he says. “It’s not every day that you come across a vehicle with the particulars this one has in its current rust free state. I do, however, foresee an LS swap in the near future though.” Chuck would agree that he learns something new with every single truck he finishes. At the end of this project, he’s come away with a real gem of knowledge that he’d like to leave with our readers. [/divider]\n",

    "12.  Compare your polarity scores of your summaries to the polarity scores of the initial article.  Is there a difference?  Why do you think that may or may not be?.  Answer in this Markdown cell.  The article’s polarity score may be close to zero, reflecting a neutral sentiment due to a balance of positive and negative content. In contrast, the summaries, filtered for sentences exceeding specific positive sentiment cutoffs, are likely to show significantly higher polarity scores. This occurs because the filtering mechanism excludes neutral or negative sentences, resulting in summaries that highlight more positive sentiments. Additionally, sentiment analysis tools like TextBlob may interpret nuances in language differently based on the analysis method, further skewing results. Consequently, it is common for summaries focused on positive sentiment to have higher polarity scores than the initial articles, emphasizing the importance of understanding the potential biases in sentiment filtering techniques when interpreting summarization outcomes."

    "13. Based on your reading of the original article, which summary do you think is better (if there's a difference).  Why do you think this might be? Based on the analysis of the original article and the summaries generated using both tokens and lemmas for sentiment filtering, the choice of which summary is better may depend on the specific context and purpose of the summary. If the goal is to capture a more nuanced and comprehensive overview of the article's content, the summary based on token sentiment analysis may be more suitable, as it may include a broader range of sentences and potentially offer a more balanced representation of the article's themes, including both positive and negative perspectives.On the other hand, if the intent is to provide an upbeat or motivational recap, the lemma-based summary might be preferable as it focuses on more positively skewed sentences, possibly highlighting key positive insights that resonate with readers. The difference in summarization outcomes likely stems from the way each method interprets sentiment. Token analysis might retain more contextually significant sentences, while lemma analysis tends to emphasize simplified, positive aspects of the content. Ultimately, the better summary will depend on the audience and the intended use—whether for a comprehensive understanding or for inspiration and positivity."
